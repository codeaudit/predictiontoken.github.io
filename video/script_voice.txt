How to bet on (or against) Trump using PredictionToken
Think of PredictionToken as a factory with machines that mint tokens.
Each machine specializes in tokens associated with a particular event.
For example, this machine asks the question "Will Trump win the election?"
Each machine, which is actually an Ethereum smart contract, has two main functions: create and redeem.
At any time, you can turn any amount of Ether into the same amount of Trump Yes and Trump No tokens.
Up until the election is over, you can always redeem your 1 Trump Yes and 1 Trump No token back into 1 Ether.
When the election is over, the trusted Oracle Reality Keys will determine whether Trump won and cryptographically sign the result.
If Trump is the winner, then you can redeem Trump Yes tokens back into Ether, and Trump No tokens are worth nothing.
If Trump is the loser, then you can redeem Trump No tokens back into Ether, and Trump Yes tokens are worth nothing.
So how exactly do you bet on or against Trump using the tokens you created?
Simply head to EtherDelta, the official decentralized exchange for PredictionToken.
If you think Trump will win, you can sell your Trump no token.
If you think Trump will lose, you can sell your Trump yes token.
Suppose you think Trump will lose, so you offer your Trump Yes token for 0.2 Ether.
If someone takes your offer, then you have now paid 0.8 Ether (1 Ether to mint the tokens, minus 0.2 Ether to sell the Trump Yes token).
And you own 1 Trump No token.
If Trump loses, you can redeem the Trump No token for 1 Ether, and your overall profit will be 0.2 Ether.
If Trump wins, your Trump No token is worthless, and your overall loss will be 0.8 Ether.
